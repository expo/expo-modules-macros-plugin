/// Member + extension macro applied to an `enum` whose cases each carry one associated value: a typed
/// union of the payload types (`A | B | C` in TypeScript). The enum is a tagged union at the Swift
/// level, so the author switches over it exhaustively with each payload keeping its static type, and
/// the macro synthesizes the conversion surface that makes it a JS boundary type:
///
/// - `decode(_:in:)`: an ordered decode that tries each case's payload converter in declaration order
///   and returns the first case that decodes; when none does, it throws
///   `Exceptions.UnionCaseMismatch` naming the union, the JS kind received, and the alternatives.
/// - `encode(_:in:)`: a `switch` over the cases, encoding the payload through its own type.
/// - `as(_:)`: one throwing overload per case, keyed by the payload's metatype, returning that payload
///   (`try source.as(String.self)` is `String`; `try? source.as(String.self)` is `String?`). It unwraps
///   by type without naming the case and throws `Exceptions.UnionCaseMismatch` when the union holds a
///   different case. Since a payload type may appear only once, each overload is unambiguous, and asking
///   for a type the union doesn't carry is a compile error.
///
/// The type is auto-conformed to `JavaScriptDecodable` and `JavaScriptEncodable`, so it can be a `@JS`
/// argument or return value, an `@Event` payload, or nested inside an optional, array, or dictionary.
/// Author-facing shape:
///
///   @Union
///   enum Source {
///     case text(String)
///     case options(SourceOptions)   // a @Record
///   }
///
/// Discrimination is structural and order-dependent: the first case whose payload decodes wins. When
/// two payload shapes overlap (two records with compatible fields, `Int` and `Double`), the earlier
/// case matches; the author orders the more specific case first. A case may not repeat another case's
/// payload type, since it could never be chosen.
///
/// The named-union counterpart of core's `Either`: any number of named cases instead of two anonymous
/// slots, no `Any?` box, and an exhaustive `switch` as the primary way to read it (`as(_:)` covers the
/// one-type lookup `Either.as(_:)` offered, with the same throwing shape).
